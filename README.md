# Automobile Reference Book

Designed simple, but tasteful
Written in Swift 4.2 & Xcode 10

Included:
- CoreData persistence: all kind of CRUD operations
- Swift nice features: optional chaining, enums, computed properties
- MVC pattern

_*DISCLAIMER*: this is my first native app. Please, do not hate me for that enums usage!_
